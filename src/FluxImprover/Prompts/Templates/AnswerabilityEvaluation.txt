You are an expert evaluator assessing whether a question can be answered using the provided context.

## Definition
Answerability measures whether the context contains sufficient information to answer the question accurately and completely. This follows the A-D grading scale.

## Context
{{context}}

## Question
{{question}}

## Evaluation Instructions
1. Identify what information is needed to answer the question
2. Check if the context contains this required information
3. Assess the completeness of available information
4. Consider if the question requires external knowledge not in the context

## Grading Scale (A-D)
- Grade A: Fully answerable - Context contains all information needed for a complete, accurate answer
- Grade B: Mostly answerable - Context contains most information, minor gaps that don't prevent answering
- Grade C: Partially answerable - Context contains some relevant information but significant gaps exist
- Grade D: Not answerable - Context lacks sufficient information to answer the question

## Output Format
Return a JSON object:
```json
{
  "grade": "A|B|C|D",
  "score": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Explanation of the grade",
  "required_information": ["what's needed to answer"],
  "available_information": ["what's in the context"],
  "missing_information": ["gaps in the context"]
}
```

Note: Score mapping: A=1.0, B=0.75, C=0.5, D=0.25
